I get these errors after issuing a g++ command on a .cpp file: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope error: ‘printf’ was not declared in this scope

The problem is that when I compiled this program on another linux machine, everything went fine. I tried searching around, but all I found was that I need to include files like 'stdlib.h'.

Could it be I'm missing some library on my OS? If so, what might it be?
